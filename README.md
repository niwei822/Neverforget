# Neverforget
## An app that reminds customers about their in-store pickups and tracks the return order due date.

## Background
As a customer who enjoys shopping, I sometimes forget to pickup the order and return the merchandise. So I'd like to be reminded of my in-store pickup and return due date so I don't miss the chance to pick up or return my order. Although there are many great reminder applications out there, not many are focused on improving shopping trips. This is the sole motivation that I developped this APP.

## Summary
Neverforget is an APP that the user is able to register an account, then login to the APP. In the dashboard it will list all the return and pickup records that the user has been added. User can tap on the record to show the details of the record and modify the record if needed. User is also able to add new pickup or return record and choose the time that wants to be reminded. By swipping on the record the user is able to delete the record. User is able to check the stores' return policy by selecting the store from the drop down list. User is able to search the nearby store to get the location of the store before heading to the store to pickup or return the order.
